            <p class="rad-4-p"> If you want to run user tests with friends and family or even random people in the
                street, it is interesting to show them the 30 second video before making them try to prototype in order
                to understand their expectations from the video vs. the actual game they try.<br><br>Make it obvious
                with visual elements that help understand the objective and controls of the game, like with the target
                used in Viatcheslav Tarasov’s Purple Diver or Fabrika Games’ Draw Car with the space dedicated to
                drawing.

            <p class="rad-5-p"> People will be watching the gameplay videos of your games on their phone’s Facebook
                feed, everything will seem smaller than when displayed in Unity or as a video on your computer screen.
                You should also consider whether your gameplay video is understandable if someone watches iton a small
                screen. With an average watch time of 3 to 5 seconds, this is an accelerated elevator
                pitch!<br><br>Think of the moment when you decide to click on a random video on YouTube just because it
                has an attractive thumbnail - it’s the same idea for your game videos.
