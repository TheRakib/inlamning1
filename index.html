                <h2>Youtubability</h2><br>
                <p class="rad2-p"> A key driver of youtubability is <strong>the clarity of your gameplay to a potential
                        player.<br><br> Gameplay</strong> clarity will help you achieve the full potential of your game
                    by working on
                    getting
                    <strong>the lowest possible CPIs</strong> for your games.<br><br>Many elements can be used to make
                    your game clearer
                    :<br><br>For
                    instance, ask yourself if a user’s inte-raction with the game is <strong>evident,</strong> for
                    example, can she tell
                    which character she <strong>controls?</strong> Is the <strong>objective clear?</strong> Does it look
                    <strong>fun to play?</strong> Has she understood
                    the game after 1 second (great!) or after 10 seconds (too long!).<br><br>Make sure to <strong>use
                        colours</strong> to
                    help
                    indicate the gameplay rules. For instance, in Helix Jump, obstacles are <strong>clearly
                        contrasted</strong> (in
                    orange here) and instantly recognized as a threat.

            <p class="rad-4-p"> If you want to run user tests with friends and family or even random people in the
                street, it is interesting to show them the 30 second video before making them try to prototype in order
                to <strong>understand their</strong> expectations from the video vs. the actual game they
                try.<br><br><strong>Make it obvious</strong>
                with visual elements that help <strong>understand the objective and controls</strong> of the game, like
                with the target
                used in Viatcheslav Tarasov’s Purple Diver or Fabrika Games’ Draw Car with the space dedicated to
                drawing.

            <p class="rad-5-p"> People will be watching the gameplay videos of your games <strong>on their phone’s
                    Facebook
                    feed,</strong> everything will seem smaller than when displayed in Unity or as a video on your
                computer screen.
                <strong>You should also consider whether your gameplay video is understandable if someone watches iton a
                    small
                    screen.</strong> With an average watch time of 3 to 5 seconds, this is an <strong>accelerated
                    elevator
                    pitch!</strong><br><br>Think of the moment when you decide to click on a random video on YouTube
                just because it
                has an attractive thumbnail - it’s the same idea for your game videos.
